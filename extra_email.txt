Hi everyone,

I've uploaded the R-package version of CONSTRU to Julia's github (https://github.com/chifman/Constru)

I have also attached it to this email.
I have also a html version of the README to this email.

I've moved the previous CONSTRU programs into https://github.com/chifman/Constru/tree/main/extra_constru_app
All of the files starting with extra_* are files that are not part of the package, just a lot of extra files that were part of the development and past programs.

====

Let me know if the program is working and if you notice anything wrong with the documentation. 

Help me review the README. By they way, do you have a description for prognostic_variable PS2 and PS3?


Thanks,
Ming
